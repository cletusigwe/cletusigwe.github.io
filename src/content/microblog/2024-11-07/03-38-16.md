I feel like to actually write good stuff I need to stop waiting till a post idea has a title before typing the first words. Titles normally encode the range or depth of the content and most times you dont really know what you are trying to say concretely, just that you want to articulate a thought. So title-ing it right from the start is like a cock block in a way.
