I have explored my personal-life-updates-on-a-blog fetish and I think am getting bored of it now. Might nuke all these content soon and only put respectable updates here.

One thing though is that I really need to shut the voices in my head. I start writing one of these respectable long essays and realize midway that most of my ideas are not the norm here and are not things I would wish to publish and spend a lot of time defending in the future, and the thought of having to argue over ideas eats up my energy to write the post and I just stop writing.

Well, I sure still need to write them at some point but feels convenient not to do it now.
