omg!!!

I have been tracking my expenses for sometime now, meticulously writing down every transaction I do in a notebook and I finally know what is sucking up all my income.

It should have been obvious but I really was not paying attention. It was FUEL all along!!

My generator is reasonably fuel-efficient and I initially used to just get fuel in small amounts, so I never paid much attention to how much I spent on it.

Its insane that even though the cost of a litre is at an all-time low(1000/litre of fuel as at today) due to the second-order effects of the Dangote refinery, I am on track to spending 50k+ on fuel per month. Thats 600k per year on electricity, excluding the costs of maintaining my generator. This is unacceptable!

I must figure out how to get solar.  A good solar setup might cost me 2m but the insane upsides I can gain from it is worth every penny. I dont like debts, so I would really prefer to pay for the whole thing upfront. I just need to put in more work and stop lazying about.
