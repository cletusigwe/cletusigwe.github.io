now I think of it, the last update's analogy is very ambiguous. what i meant was that since sex is primarily for reproduction, but we enjoyed it so much that we elevated it to a source of pleasure and so had to invent condoms to keep things in control. 
my point is that I enjoy writing nim code, and not every thing can be justified by "industry standards" or "job market demands". 
bad analogy, I know.
But I think I wil deploy it in a real life convo one of these days.
