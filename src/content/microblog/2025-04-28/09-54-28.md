The v0.dev form factor is superior to the Cursor LLM in IDE experience. It will take many years for it to play out but I think the future would give LLM their own seperate specialized environment to write and modify code which humnas can then import into their human optimised IDE.

I am going to be paying for chatgpt plus and v0 premium because it gives me super-powers.
