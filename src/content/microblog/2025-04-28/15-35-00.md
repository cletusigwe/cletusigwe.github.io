In the 2 decades of my existence and extensive experience with this job called life, I have never seen grown men suck dic* as enthusiastically as all these state governors defecting to APC. 

These people really have no shame or backbone. How does this country actually work? Do the will of the citizens ever matter when decisions are being made?

The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind..
