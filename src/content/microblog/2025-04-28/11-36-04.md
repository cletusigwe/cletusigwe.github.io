Bryan Johnson is trying hard to start a religion from scratch. He has the basic superficial stuff down: 
- Eternal life
- Prophets and followers
- Experimental miracles or expectations for one

But he is failing in a crucial aspect. He is not writing any worthy sermons. He is yet to deliver his sermon on the mount. He is confused on who should be God: him or AGI. Instead of fixing these salient and urgent matters, he is focused on injecting botox into his penis.
