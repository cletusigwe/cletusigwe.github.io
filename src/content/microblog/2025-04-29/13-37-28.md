I saw a twitter post with low engagement where the author was looking for a freelance dev to redesign their company website. Obviously this job will pay well but I just felt dread looking at it. It mentioned they had upto 30 pages on the site and all I could think of was how dreadfull it would be to spend a whole month of non-stop work rewriting some react codebase or similar.

I am happy I got to try out this freelance path in the last year and I am 100% sure that I hate it now, especially the webdev lane. I know I still love to code but freelance is the most straightforward path for me to earn because I am spawning with no network, family wealth or anything to fall back on if I fail.

I am still figuring out my next moves to escape this path but before the end of the year am sure I would be executing on a new strategy.
