you grow up with a nickname, it feels cool for a while and then you get sick of it. 

you pick up a pseudonym to impress your friends and look cool, as you get older you start to regret it and hate the sound of the name you had thought was cool. 

a decade has passed, you have experienced life and finally you realize your original name was actually the only way you wanted to be addressed. 

is it too late to change? will you continue to allow people address you with a name you hate? or will you finally turn and hug the shadow you kept running from?
