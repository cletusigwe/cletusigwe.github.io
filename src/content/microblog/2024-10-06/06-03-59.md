can all these entertainment algorithms get better at recognizing niche interests and amplifying them? I have youtube disabled by default on my phone and use `newpipe` as my yt client, but newpipe cant give me content recommendations which makes it less addictive but also more boring to use over extended periods of time. So once in a while I enable youtube so I can get entertained but, the recommendation algorithm always tries to force(bait?) me into watching normie content(reaction vids, softcore porn etc) and once you take one bait, the rest of your feed just turns into normie fest. am not complaining about the normie content though, I just wish the algorithm understood how the human mind worked bettter and recognises when I consume bait content and doesnt give me more bait.
