everyday I look at my phone screen and beg it to enhance my existence. 

Just do something, anything. Its a pitiful way to live. You switch between the same apps in a humiliation loop, begging to be entertained and yet nothing gives you the highness you crave. 4chan used to have enough entropy to keep it slightly entertaining, all you had to do was develop filters to the rude comments, but now that too is meh. Your brain is just walking around in a self constructed cage looking for a way out.

This brain needs to be lit up and it just isnt happening.
