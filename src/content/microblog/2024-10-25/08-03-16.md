Hi. you stop posting for a day, then it turns to 2, then 3 and before you know it a week of no updates has gone by. 

Nothing much has occurred in the past few days except that I worked hard on somethings and slacked in other things. I am starting to get worried about my lifestyle and I feel like everything is pulling me in different directions resulting in net stagnation.

We have a practical class this morning and I have zero motivation to go there and am worried that my drive for school is gone.
