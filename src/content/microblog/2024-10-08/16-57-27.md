which media player do people use on Android these days?
Playit was good but they have intentionally enshitified the app.
VLC has become slow and I dont know why.
MPV(last I used it) felt very unatural to use.

This is 2024?? whats going on? Maybe I will just write my own by wraping ffmpeg and calling it a day
