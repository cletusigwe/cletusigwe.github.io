I have come to notice that some people are actually very very selfish. Am mostly referring to people who are very willing to leech onto you once you extend a helping hand, make all their problems your problem, suck up all your energy and resources and quickly move onto the next victim when the nectar dries up. 

I cannot decide to stop helping people just to save myself from the pests, but I have developed a new rule of thumb on how to do it.

I will only extend a helping hand to somebody once I see evidence that they are trying to solve their own problem and not relying on a miraculous "destiny helper" to fix their shit.
