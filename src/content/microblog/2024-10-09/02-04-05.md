I should revive my passion for economics. I have kind of become a hollowed out version of myself, the things I do now are the things I already learnt to do a long time ago. All my new skills lie within the same domain(programming) and my knowledge on everything else is on a steady decline.

This is surely a recipe for failure, because to create useful things with computers you only need to teach the computer how to accomplish a task that exists in another domain. Simple knowledge of computer commands wont get you rich, solving problems for other people with your knowledge will.

I digress. What am just saying is that I need to read more random stuff and have fun learning instead of filtering learning opportunities based on expected returns.
