~~Given Nigeria's reputation on the internet, I have tried to be more careful on how I interact with non-nigerian folks on the internet.~~

~~I dont semd unnecessary DMs because I imagine they think am hatching some kind of fraud scheme.~~

~~The only thing I can do is make it big then use my new influence to show that not everyone is trying to scam.~~

This is cope. I have become a master of self-sabotage. Uzo stop self-limiting. Send the DMs first before you conclude on what they are thinking.
