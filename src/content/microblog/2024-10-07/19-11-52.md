I used to think that saturating my schedule with "work" would fix me but it infact has the opposite effect. It has made me worse:
1. Am always tired because just thinking of all the pile of work waiting for me makes me weak
2. I cant act on new inspirations for projects because I already have enough work left unfinished
3. Thinking of 1 and 2 makes me sad, and I cant code if am sad because my brain shuts down

Hopefully I would clear up my schedule before december and enter 2025 wiser.
