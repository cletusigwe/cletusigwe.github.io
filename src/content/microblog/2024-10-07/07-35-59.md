Was browsing /g/ on 4chan and came across this [thread on nim](https://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/102700203)
People keep citing lack of documentation as nim's weak point but I just feel like the docs are good enough to get useful work done. Maybe they need tutorials and shit that walk you through stuff like a baby.

> also araq's opinion on master vs main git branches is so based, I have always made sure to call original branch of my git repos, `master` :D
