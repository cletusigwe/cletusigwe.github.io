programming is kind of an elitist job. we have "flow states" and expect everyone else not to interrupt us, which is easy when you live alone.. but staying at home, I have to help do some chores and tasks, and explaining why I cant be interrupted makes me sound like I am demanding some unfair special treatment just because I push buttons on a keyboard.
