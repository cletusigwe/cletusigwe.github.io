Hi, my name is Cletus Igwe. I am currently a 300 level Mechatronics Engineering student at [FUTO](https://futo.edu.ng/).

I love messing around with my computer and playing occasional games of  chess. Feel free to ping me on lichess [@cletusigwe]()(current preferred account) or [@uzo2005]()(old account), for a quick game or 2.
<!-- Hi,

Call me Cletus. Or Uzo.  -->
<!-- I used to think `uzo2005` would be my internet id, but someone beat me to it on twitter so I changed my mind. Now I just use my real name everywhere, `@cletusigwe` on most sites and `@0xcletusigwe` when the `@cletusigwe`  handle is already taken. -->
<!-- 
I used to be addicted to chess, now I just play it when there is nothing else to do, but am always looking for a challenge so feel free to ping me on lichess [@uzo2005]()(old account) [@cletusigwe]()(current preferred account), for a quick game or 2.  -->

<!-- I am supposed to be a mechatronics undergraduate at [FUTO](https://futo.edu.ng), but between the two of us, I feel lost here. I skip most of my lectures and spend my time hacking on random stuff or freelancing simple landing page websites for other students who need them. One such website is [housemusichq](). -->

This site is a work in progress, thanks for stopping by.
<!-- I have some unique worldviews that almost nobody I know in real life agrees with me on, and I have attempted to summarise them all in [my manifesto]() -->
