Hi, my name is Cletus Igwe. I am currently a 300 level Mechatronics Engineering student at [FUTO](https://futo.edu.ng/).

I love messing around with my computer and playing occasional games of chess. Feel free to ping me on lichess [@cletusigwe](https://lichess.org/@/cletusigwe)(current preferred account) or [@uzo2005](https://lichess.org/@/uzo2005)(old account), for a quick game or 2.

This site is still a work in progress, thanks for stopping by.
