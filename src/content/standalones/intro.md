Hi, my name is Cletus Igwe. Close friends call me Uzo, short for Uzochukwu which is my middle name. I am currently a 400 level Mechatronics Engineering student at [FUTO](https://futo.edu.ng/).

I like to write computer programs and currently sustain myself by building websites in exchange for money. I am getting tired of the freelance career path and looking for other opportunities to learn new things and apply my current skillsets.
