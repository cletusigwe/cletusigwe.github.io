Many people believe that every single problem we are facing in this country can be traced back to our british colonial masters.
While this can be argued to be true[^problems have this unique ability that you can either pick any past event or anybody in government position and argue it as the source of the problem] I want to make a point that these essay is mostly addressed to yahoo boys who try to justify their actions as taking back all that was stolen from us during colonialism.
